                  Z-Stream functions as a search engine and content aggregator
                  that indexes publicly available media from across the
                  internet.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We don&apos;t host, store, or control any media files -
                  everything is sourced from external third-party websites that

                  <br />
                  Our automated systems simply provide links to content
                  that&apos;s already available online, without bypassing any
                  security measures.

                We&apos;re a search index. The actual video files live on
                third-party hosts that we don&apos;t own and don&apos;t
                control — we just point at them. If a file disappears
                upstream, our link breaks the same day. The host is the only
                party who can take a file down.
                <br />
                <br />
                That said, we don&apos;t want to make life harder for rights
                holders. If you own the rights to a title and send us a
                notice with enough detail to identify it, we&apos;ll delist
                it from our search so it can&apos;t be reached from anywhere
                on the site — and we&apos;ll happily tell you exactly which
                upstream sources we were pulling it from, so you can chase
                the files at their actual source.
                <br />
                <br />
                Blocking a title here won&apos;t make it disappear from the
                internet — it only stops users from finding it through us.
                But that&apos;s the part we control, and we&apos;ll act on it
                in good faith.
